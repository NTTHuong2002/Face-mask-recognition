In this tutorial, we’ll discuss how we can use computer vision in our two-phase face mask detector, detailing how our computer vision and deep learning pipeline will be implemented.

From there, we’ll review the dataset we’ll be using to train our custom face mask detector.

I’ll then show you how to implement a Python script to train a face mask detector on our dataset using Keras and TensorFlow.

We’ll use this Python script to train a face mask detector and review the results.

Given the trained face mask detector, we’ll proceed to implement two more additional Python scripts used to:

Detect  face masks in images
Detect face masks in real-time video streams
